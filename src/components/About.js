        I'm a natural problem-solver who is passionate about enhancing people's
        lives and helping others in any possible way. My background is in
        Psychology, and I did my undergrad at George Mason University where I
        specialized in Work and Organizational Psychology. I understand and
        value the significance of diversity, inclusion, and collaboration in
        teams. I'm also a huge advocate for mental health and the concept that
        health encompasses so much more than just our physical health.

        I've always been into creating my own things, my own projects, and this
        is how I found coding. About two years ago, I discovered a cool and
        user-friendly coding app and I could NOT stop using it; little by little
        what initially was a hobby became something I was really interested in
        understanding. I recently graduated from Georgia Tech where I completed
        their intense, immersive Full Stack Software Enigineer Bootcamp.
