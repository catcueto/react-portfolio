          Hey! I'm a natural problem-solver who is passionate about enhancing
          people's lives and helping others in any possible way. My background
          is in Psychology, and I did my undergrad at George Mason University
          where I specialized in Work and Organizational Psychology. I
          understand and value the significance of diversity, inclusion, and
          collaboration in teams. I'm also a huge advocate for mental health and
          the concept that health encompasses so much more than just our
          physical health.
